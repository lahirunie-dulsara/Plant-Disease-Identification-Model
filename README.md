# 🌿 Plant Disease Identification Model

This project is a ML-based system designed to detect plant diseases from leaf images. It uses image classification techniques to help farmers and researchers identify diseases early and take preventive actions.

## 📌 Features

- Classifies leaf images into healthy or diseased categories
- Trained on a labeled dataset of various plant species
- Supports prediction on custom images
- High performance using a CNN or transfer learning model
- GUI interface using Tkinter for easy interaction
